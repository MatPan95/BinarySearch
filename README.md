# Binary Search Algorithm

This repository contains Java classes related to binary search algorithms.

## Overview

The `BinarySearch` class provides a generic implementation of binary search for arrays of elements that implement the `Comparable` interface. It efficiently searches for a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Features

- **Generic**: Works with any type `T` that implements `Comparable`.
- **Efficient**: Time complexity of `O(log n)`, where `n` is the size of the array.
- **Simple Interface**: Single method `binarySearch` for performing binary search.
